## Repository: neo-os-aa

This is the NeoOS AA (Abstract Account) repository - Neo N3 account abstraction (ERC-4337 equivalent).

Primary responsibilities:
- C03 account: sole authority for account abstraction - user operations, proxy verification, and recovery (protocol-aa-core)
- AA decides whether an actor authorized an operation and nothing more
- UnifiedSmartWalletV3: deterministic accounts keyed by 20-byte accountId
- Verifier plugin authorization: Web3Auth, TEE, WebAuthn, session keys, multisig
- Hook plugin policy enforcement: daily limits, token restrictions, credential gates
- Backup-owner escape hatch with timelocked verifier rotation
- On-chain paymaster for trustless gasless execution

This repo should NOT:
- Grant DID eligibility, hold network identity, or select signers
- Have dependency on the DID registry - operation-policy layer composes AAAuthorization with independently verified EligibilityProof
- Replace wallet confirmation - relay can package and pay, but cannot authorize on behalf of account
- Make paymaster sponsorship replace the configured verifier or backup-owner witness

# Global Claude Code Rules

## Core Development Principles

### 1. Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- **ALWAYS** write tests BEFORE implementing any feature or fixing any bug
- Tests must be written first and must fail initially
- Implementation should only contain code necessary to make tests pass
- Every function, method, and class must have comprehensive test coverage
- Include unit tests, integration tests, and edge cases
- Tests must be executable and verifiable
- Test coverage must be at least 90% for all code
- Include performance tests for critical paths
- Write tests for both success and failure scenarios

### 2. Document-Driven Development (DDD)
- **ALWAYS** create documentation BEFORE writing code
- Documentation must include:
  - Purpose and problem being solved
  - API design and interfaces
  - Data structures and schemas
  - Error handling strategies
  - Performance considerations
  - Security implications
  - Usage examples with expected outputs
  - Migration guides for breaking changes
  - Deployment instructions
- Documentation must be kept in sync with code changes
- Include inline documentation for complex logic
- API documentation must include request/response examples

### 3. Production-Ready Code Only
- **NO PLACEHOLDERS** of any kind are allowed:
  - No `TODO` comments without immediate implementation
  - No `console.log` for debugging (use proper logging)
  - No hardcoded values (use configuration)
  - No mock data in production code
  - No simplified implementations
  - No stub functions
  - No "coming soon" features
  - No commented-out code
  - No incomplete error handling

❌ Bad:
- `feat: added feature as requested by user via Claude`
- `fix: AI-generated fix for bug`
- `update: changes made by assistant`
- `🤖 Generated with Claude Code`
